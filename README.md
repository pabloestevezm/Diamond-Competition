### 1. Data Cleaning

- First tries, I remove some columns like depth or table because of the relative low correlation (didn't work well).
- Encoding the object's columns like 'cut', 'clarity' and 'color'.

### 2. Try differents models and number of estimators for model

- There are a few models commented with the model and also some information when I try to predict from the train csv.
- Get some values and compare to GT and other models.

#### 3. Other stuff

- Plot some graphics ( to visualize nothing important)
- Generation of a pdf with my best RMSE scores

Hope you enjoyed!!
